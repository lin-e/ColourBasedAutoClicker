# ColourBasedAutoClicker
I really don't know what this is for. Clicks if there's a colour on screen?

I wrote the code for this ages ago, originally for a screenshot tool. Modified it so that it would get a colour and click if it passes a threshold. Please not that this is not a proper release, and should not be considered good (or even functional) code.

For use on [this 'game'] (http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime)

Uses LowLevelHook from [here] (https://gist.github.com/BahNahNah/35dbd09b1a4ffe7193e1)
