# ColourBasedAutoClicker
I really don't know what this is for. Clicks if there's a colour on screen?

I wrote the code for this ages ago, originally for a screenshot tool. Modified it so that it would get a colour and click if it passes a threshold. Please not that this is not a proper release, and should not be considered good (or even functional) code.
